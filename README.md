# EECI IGSC - Game Theory with Engineering Applications
Code used during the Spring School on Game Theory with Engineering Applications.

Tutorial_01.py is the introduction to Python.

EvolutionaryTournament.py contains the code for the first activity on Monday. To run the tournament, just call the function and pass the parameters you are interested in, including the set of strategies that will compete in the tournament. Bear in mind that only 1-memory strategies are considered in this tournament and only the last T time steps are plotted (T is a randomised value).

EvolutionaryGames.py contains the code to set up the replicator dynamics and plot them (fractions of population vs time).

Finally, EvolutionaryGames_Learning.py considers a reinforcement learning approach for the evolutionary dynamics.
